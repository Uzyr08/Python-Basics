Medical information plays a vital role in healthcare by aiding healthcare professionals in making
precise diagnoses, delivering effective treatments, and informed decisions about patient care [1, 2].
Within the realm of medical information, medical imaging stands out as an invaluable source.
In modern healthcare, medical imaging has become an essential tool, offering crucial visual
insights into the internal structures and conditions of the human body [3]. Within dentistry,
dental imaging refers to the use of various imaging techniques to capture detailed images of the
oral and maxillofacial structures. These images are invaluable for diagnosing dental conditions,
planning treatments, and monitoring oral health. Dental imaging plays a vital role in enabling
dental professionals to visualize and evaluate the teeth, jaws, and supporting structures.
Dental images can be acquired through different modalities, including X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and intraoral cameras. Each modality offers
specific advantages and is selected based on the specific diagnostic requirements and clinical
scenario.
Deep learning, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and computer vision, has
become a revolutionary area of dentistry. Thanks to the use of these cutting-edge technologies, the
dental industry is undergoing a period of transformation in which the analysis of dental images
and the integration of artificial intelligence are revolutionizing many aspects of dental care [4]. By
harnessing the capabilities of deep learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, dentistry
has the potential to dramatically improve diagnostic performance, streamline treatment planning
processes and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.
The utilization of CNNs in dentistry encompasses the detection of structures like teeth and
bone, as well as the identification of pathologies such as caries and apical lesions. Additionally,
CNNs are employed to segment images by isolating the areas of interest and classify them based
on specific features like enamel caries lesions or cysts. However, it is important to acknowledge
the limitations within this field. One of the significant weaknesses lies in the relatively small and
private nature of the available datasets, which restricts the diversity and size of the training data.
Moreover, some of the AI solutions developed in this domain may lack robustness and stability,
raising concerns about their reliability and performance.
To analyze dental images for tasks like lesion detection, age or sex determination, and human
identification, tooth segmentation plays a vital role. In the field of oral medicine, the automatic
segmentation of teeth in panoramic radiographs is a significant focus of research in image analysis.
However, segmenting teeth in panoramic radiographs presents challenges due to the presence of
other anatomical structures such as the chin, spine, and jaws.
Within the existing literature, a multitude of studies have employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tooth segmentation and identification in dental images. These advanced deep
learning techniques have exhibited promising outcomes by leveraging the capabilities of CNNs to
extract meaningful features and accurately segment teeth in dental images.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a summary of the current state of the
art in automatic tooth segmentation and references relevant surveys in the field. In Section 3, we
delve into the principles of deep learning, exploring its various categories, common applications,
and specifically zooming in on the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within
the context of medical image analysis in computer vision. The subsequent sections 4, 5, and 6
present the study methodologies, research topics, and synthesis findings, offering detailed insights
into the conducted research. Finally, Sections 7 and 8 discuss the studyâ€™s limitations and provide
a conclusion.
